# Bubble Sorting Algorithm

Bubble Sort is the algorithm to sort elements in an array by ascending or descending. The algorithm will partition the array into a sorted partition and unsorted partition.

# Implementation
The algorithm is very simple, we repeatedly swap the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
